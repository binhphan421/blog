Is it worth it?

So much of adult decision making weighs this question. We balance potential, and cost, whether the mass is emotional, financial, time, or whatever we deem of value. We are the granters of weight.

This is today's battle, my writing laid to the scale. My mind has sustained itself with cathartic sensations upon each finished piece; but what has really changed? Am I different? Better?

I fear being the snake smitten with its own tail. A cycle of self produced hatred, and homemade delusions persisting for an eternity. I fear as I am now, when the temple drums sound in her name, I will wish for mine to follow. To end eternity, I would swallow myself whole and escape the question. 

Is it worth it?

Yes. You're trying now. Aren't you?
