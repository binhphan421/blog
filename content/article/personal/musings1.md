#### 1 - Bear

This morning, like clockwork, she called asking when I was coming home, having already forgotten our day together yesterday as we dropped by Dieu Ngu Temple to pray for my father, drank sugar cane juice in the car as I drove around Westminster and ate at 1.99 Restaurant, where the meals are thirteen dollars. I gave my routine excuse: today was Sunday, implying to her that I never visited on Sundays. 

Both days of the weekend used to be for her. Now it just hurts too much. How much do I have to bear? The guilt of not being present, and the despair for when I am. 

#### 2 - Hope

With each step the No Kings protesters took down Main Street, Santa Ana, a chord was struck within my chest. They moved with a vigor I seldom see in Orange County. This is, for the most part, Trump Land, especially where I grew up in Westminster.

Their determination to brave the injustices underneath the California Sun awoken a hope in me. We've grown accustomed to being the apples among oranges around here. Maybe, we the people, are not as rotten at the cord as I believed. 

#### 3 - Steps

I want to end this obsession. But in the dimmed theatre, amongst a sea of strangers and eyes, for a moment, I wished she was among them, watching as I was.

I'm thankful the movie swept me away, as if it was my first time watching. Tears welled, as she began to blame herself. Then once again, when she could finally look forward. 

And even the movie I didn't come for stole me away. Within just under an hour, with discovery of music and awkward stares, I laughed and forgot. 

I'm trying. I'm really am.

#### 4 - Passed

Have I lost my chance to experience youthful, pure, and unadulterated love? Has time passed me by? Am I fated to dream of a love I can never experience? 

Is this why I gravitate towards romance stories? I'm in love with their honesty. Something I wish I wasn't scared of.

#### 5 - Father's Day

We have never celebrated this day as a family since you passed. Maybe we were all scared of finding out much it would hurt without you here for it.

I used to park at where you picked me up from school, with a bag of Carls Jr or In N Out, to eat and see what you saw as you waited for your youngest to saunter his way out of the campus.

Now the pain has dulled, and I sit here writing. Although as you probably noticed, I teared up again thinking about how much we've missed you.

Happy Father's Day, Ba.
