I was a cry baby.

I was when I fell off my brother's hand me down bike with scraped knees and wails that summoned my father's aid. 

I was when I hid under a leaning mattress, where tears blurred my vision of a broke porcelain bowl that was a victim of my mother's frustration with my eating habits. 

And while time led to the death of most triggers and molded me into a more resilient, stable and normal man of society, I did not completely outgrow the trait. I cried when I double faulted my last game of high school tennis, ending my team's CIF dreams. I cried on my chemistry composition book when the doctor predicted my father's future fate with cancer. I cried when it came true.

I wept when my mother rejected my plea to leave assisted housing so she could continue to live with me. I wept when she rejected that wish again after I had purchased our family's first property, a once fleeting dream shared by her and my father. I wept countless times since, as each attempt to convince fails, and I'm left with the burden to remember the painful words, as she wonders if they were even said at all. 

And nearly everytime I lay eyes on her wilted form, or hear her confused voice, I battle to dam the torrent of regret and pain that time punishes me with, as it ruthlessly pillages what I fought for in these years of servitude to my mother. Oh, the pain of age. Oh, the regret of memory. Oh, the weakness that I feel when I whimper and snivel. 

To be a cry baby was demeaning. Shameful. The world will pile on you for shedding tears as a man. Every remark. Every moment of despair. You are driven to learn to bear it. Tears are ill fitting for one who is meant to be a rock. Unshakable. This is why I never felt like a man, still even in my *prime* years. Only a boy, trapped by the endless sky that convinces him that he could live to society's expectations.

Instead, I find the welling tears more often then ever, a thirty two year old man reverting to the sobbing child who found the strange meat his father snuck into dinner. I find cheeks with wet streaks during movies, something that never happened before 2025. I find my lungs heaving as memories not seen in years flash, leaving me to glare longingly of days past through a water stained window. I find my hands shaking at the uncertainty of an open future, as if I was the college student searching of what it felt like to be an adult. 

But I'm no longer ashamed.

I cry because I want to live. I anguish with red eyes because I want to understand what living really means to me. And with a little delusion, I convince myself that these bouts of weakness, are signs from my body screaming that I must find what I need. Even when the mind persuades the task as an impossiblity. Even if the world and its history proclaims me frail.

I guess, this is just what a cry baby does. And that is what I am.
