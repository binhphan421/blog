It is a surreal, body-escaping experience recalling days past when my vision of the dream that embodied what life meant to me was so vivid and true. With such clarity came willpower. Strength. Resilience. 

But the past has already been written, and we don't live in the bliss of our known history. Who we were then may speak but a chapter of who we are now, never the entirety. 

Today, I am blind. I am weak.  
I despair. I rage for an understanding that will never come. I fear the acceptance that will trivialize all I fought for. I wander aimlessly in prayer that a new dream will succeed the predecessor that I can no longer will to fruition. 

And I'm struggling. To keep the front for those who care. To stand. To see myself beyond anything I already am. To desire without the guilt. To want feeling like I deserve it. 

Each step forward becomes a step in place. Every plan disperses with even the weakest of gusts. Progress is no longer a bar; it is a drain, and hope is sinking.

Yet, why do I scream?  
For the godforsaken state of my mother, I curse all the gods and writers of fate.  
For the burden of living after, I damn all those who live in bliss, ignorant of my sufferings.

Why do I lash?  
Against the expectations of my parents, I swing to hide the failures I have committed in their name.  
Against the kindness of those who would still care, I thrash to disguise my paralyzing loneliness.

Why do I struggle?   
When each and every single piece I write, word I pen can only spell the misery I desperately want to escape.  
When every second in the endless day, I am assaulted by reasons to accept that it is no longer worth trying.

Why do I continue to yell, to deny, to fight, as if there is still something worth struggling for? 

Heh. Why indeed.
