Hi Mẹ. 

How are you doing? How is catching up with Ba? Have you gone and seen everything you wanted to?

I wouldn't know how to answer if you would ask me the same. With every "how are you holding up" that comes my way, "I'm okay" becomes heavier to say. Where my heart once beated, now lies the abyss, your voice no longer here to fill it. Each attempt to heal, to become whole, to climb the endless well, I am seized by the deep-rooted hooks of regret. 

I am sorry: I kept secrets. I do drink alcohol, Ba's blood strong within me. I'm kidding Mẹ. The only fault that exists for my vice is my own. 

I am sorry: I didn't take all your food. My futile attempt to demonstrate my self-sufficiency. Funny, how now I chase your mother's touch in all that I cook.

I am sorry: I called less. Seeing you wither away in your twilight years broke my heart. I was not big enough a man to bear it. I fled, only for my heart to become dust, when your phone rang, but in my hands. 

I am sorry: I never realized how fulfilling life was when I earned your smile. 100 days without it, I am deaf to the present, your silent voice the only sound in my ears. 

I still hear you greeting me at the door as I come home, as you fake your surprise. Chewing loudly on the stir fried anchovies at Kaju. Giggling while holding your grandson's hand, my nephew's laughter in perfect sync with yours. Calling for me in the Daiso aisles, waving the next item you want your precious son to buy. Singing along as I drive, your failing memory no match for music. Snoring on my couch, at peace as Pepper rustles around your frail body for the perfect napping spot. 

When you are nowhere to be found, I still hear you everywhere I go. At first, it was our memories. Now, only my impossible dream: you, still here, by my side. 

I know. I write in vain, with words in a language you hardly understand. But in the chance I could reach you, that my voice in ink would fly beyond the page it is bound, to wherever your heart now lies, at the very least, I would want you to know:

I miss you. Please don't ever forget, that I love you.

Con Mẹ (Your Son),

Binh
