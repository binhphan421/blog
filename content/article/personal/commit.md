Her presence looms in my heart and mind, capable at any moment to consume me, as a parasite does its host. Yet it is I who leech, using these yearnings for her to recklessly dream of a her I wish existed: one that would feel the same about me. 

These longings are unburdened from reality. The moon is beautiful not only when it shines, but in the night where we admire its entirety. I have fallen for a bewitching idea, ignorant that she is not just the light of my eyes, but a soul once shattered by her own scars. A person.

I am self-plagued by a farce, content with skirting the lines before truth, the ignorance of it a fuel for my fantasy. There is no love for me if I live in comfort and never cross the chasm. There is no love with only blessings; a commitment implies the whole, comforting or not, and I could never understand that if I fear the truth. 

It is time I purge this obsession of countless words: The end for my commitment to imagination, and the birth of a commitment to the life in front of me. The people who still wait. The dreams I still hope to find. With time and hopefully clarity, I pray the next time I see you, I see only but the person who stands before me, and not I what my delusion makes you to be. 

A friend maybe? With your permission, I could commit to that.
