#### Breathe

I sat on the kitchen floor with arms gripped on to the opposite shoulder, while leaning against the cabinet door, and  sheltering from the mental onslaught aimed at my loneliness. Days streaked by without smoke or whistle, yet today I find myself bombarded, struggling to make my lunch. Looking up at the white ceiling only yielded one notion: I am alone. 

Breathe, I tell myself between the bouts of deafening explosion of thoughts admist my silent hysteria. Breathe.

Who would I call once I found myself at wits end, and the pen no longer inks the answer I seek? The most present Westminster Lions tennis teammates? My once a few seconds walk turned forty minutes without traffic drive childhood friend? The one friend, where once upon a time past, I called them one of my best? My delusion's souce of inspiration? 

The phone rang. Hope existed for a moment; but I knew, there was only one who would call me. Every word shared with my mother spears me further into the bunker. When did I lose her? Why can't any of my words reach her? Or was it I who refused the rope? Is it I who who aimed my sights at her? 

Breathe. Please, just breathe.

#### Wonder

Even in these times where my thoughts and emotions best me, leaving me to writhe on the kitchen floor, despair does not yet consume me. This is not the worst it could be, I often think. It was never going to be easy, coming to terms with all that is me. I brave the struggle because I believe overcoming it will lead to the best person I could be. 

I do wonder what worse could be. If I didn't have Pepper by my side, what kind of battles would I be fighting? If loneliness cripples as I am now, what travesty can it deal when I truly am isolated? Devoid of his morning cries for me to awake from my slumber. His claws at my feet when he wants to guide me to the cabinet containing his one true love: food. His paws pushing against my collar bone, as I cradle him close to my face, breathing a little solace from his beautiful coat of fur. 

I don't deny that I want more than this. Some poor set of ears, to listen to my gibberish. A body of warmth to hug when I shiver. A pair of eyes, to stare into, when I seek comfort. A person, who would try to understand. But, the reality is, I don't have this.

I do have, an eleven pound furball nibbling at my feet to wake up, and pet him as he eats the breakfast that has already automatically dispensed. A gentleman that will properly stretch in front of me before he lays his body on top of my hand while I play League of Legends. A tiny friend who headbutts with enough force to signal his affection and concuss his owner.

And as I lightly brush his head to remind him that I'm here when he sleeps, I ponder, how grateful I am, that he lays by my side as I write this. Regardless of your inability to read these words, how dreary, a life without you would have been. I am glad you are here.
