There is a strangeness in feeling sin for the love of a color. When taken at its core, it is simply visual. Any meaning generated is only from us. The anger and love associated with reds. The serenity and woes given to blues. Correctness and nature birthed in green. Assignment of good and evil to white and black. And to cut our color key short, a vile bigot tied to the color of transgressions: orange. 

The color is seemingly simple in practice. It is the color of my wallet, which is really a pouch since I wanted space to put my spare car key for preparation of a very common event: the locking of my keys in my car. The color of my snowboarding jacket (which was not bought for the purpose of snowboarding, but since my mom hates it, snowboarding has given it a new lease on life outside of the depths of my closet). The color of the ibuprofen pills sitting to my right, as I recover from a disastrous Sunday where I discovered with food poisoning, green can come not only from nature but also my ass. 

Yet, nothing of sin. Nothing to damn orange, what simply is just a color, to the burden we give it today. An attachment to a chauvinist who when gifted power, has decided to enact cruelty. 

And I refuse to yield this color to him, as one blessed with the vision to experience it. There still exists significance for me in this forsaken color yet.

The color of robes many Buddhist monks dorne in the numerous Buddhist temples my mother and I have visited. Orange signifying their commitment to their faith and practice of asceticism. 

The color of sunset, where orange lights the evening sky, taking over the clouds above, and painting the earth below. A beauty that has enraptured me and many others since the very beginning of humanity. 

The color of a fruit that shares its namesake. One that I still remember my father in his days of life and health, peeling and plating for his sons to enjoy. 

Every single connection, regardless of weight and depth, holds value. It moves us, to put meaning into the very things we experience like the colors we see. So I cannot let a man who see lives as pieces on a board steal that from me. I wear orange for a little rebellion, by a boy who often feels helpless at how cruel the world spins. 

>> In reality, nothing but a droplet in the torrent of real world issues that far outweigh debate over the implication of color. 
>> Yet, a childish side of me yells, "We'll take it all back!" We will take back every little thing, to strip him of his power over us. 
>> And I really wanted to write about Orange.
