Faith: for the believers: an indicator of strength, found in foregoing the pursuit of the why in our present, allowing for the machinations of a being beyond our understanding to guide us into the life we were destined for. Everything has a purpose, under their rule.

Faith: for the non-believers: a sign of weakness, in our inability to process and understand our lives, such to the point we escape reason by ignorance with the conjuration of fate, destiny, or the maker. The intentional blinding of our self thought. 

The word is so entangled with religion in our langauge, to the point that I feel we miss the essence of its definition: to have trust or confidence in someone or something. This is no fault in us, faith has been hand in hand with religion since recorded human history, and the honesty of the word's nature has been muddled by those who practice theology, postively and negatively. Yet, amongst all the baggage, I find myself pondering: what is my faith?

While not the most pious or devout of people, to say I am free of any ties to religion or faithless in that regard would make a liar of me. In times of struggle, I find myself looking to my ancestors, praying for a sign in this disheveled journey of mine. Ancestors are a tangible focus of prayer for me; they lived the life, not only through texts and words. In my chest, still lies a hole that my father left with his passing, just like he too had his griefs in life. Only in death, in reunion with those we miss, will we once find ourselves whole again. Maybe, its in this belief, that the thoughts of wishing my mother would pass come to life; that she will find happiness when she is nothing but a soul the living pray to rather than struggling aimlessly in a body chained by mortality. A guilty thought, driven by the faith that my ancestors could save her since I cannot. 

And there is the faith in those who still fight. Faith in our family. Our friends. Ourselves. It is in this, I find the honesty of the word alive in my life. To put faith in others, is an act of surrender akin to some's offering to God; except, we do not wait for the divine to answer us. My trust is a living, breathing soul surviving in their own way. To put faith in ourselves, is an even greater leap of faith; when removed from destiny, we still find belief within to be the person we want to be, and to personally write the next pages in our lives. I often question whether or not, this faith lives in me. I do not see my future, and there has been times, more than I have fingers, where I kneel to the seduction of death. Now, I only believe that I won't stop walking, in hopes, that is enough. 

Strange, how reason often dictates my seperation from faith. I see the concept of faith, regardless of long lived connections to religion, is against reason. Absolute confidence in anything is contradictory to endless chase of rationale. Yet, here I am, stuck between what I think, and what I feel. Between giving up on my mom, and beliving that those who came before can save her. Between the blind trust in my family and friends against the realities of life and its problems. Between self confidence and the never ending reminders of facts and failures. A scale, where proper balance is the difference between life or death.  

I pray I find it.
