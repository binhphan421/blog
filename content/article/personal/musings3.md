#### Closed

My eyes have been closed as far as I can remember. 

We are the model minority. Amicable. Nonconfrontational. 

We can't turn blind forever. Not if we want to say we care. To our friends. Our family. Our world.

#### Neverdying

I dug this grave many times before, yet the burial never happens. The visions live. 

No matter the depth of the tomb, the beautiful poison weeds through dirt mixed of hope and agony, and I find myself wishing, praying and dreaming for a life reborn with her prescence. 

When will my heart remind itself to stand? Without her crutch. I don't know. I don't know.

#### Daggers

"Please come home if you're not busy tomorrow."

She forgets but I don't. That she said this. Her go to order at Com Tam Thanh. What condiments she likes in her pho. 

Each dropped thought lands daggers into my chest. Her earnest request, the coup de grace. 

I've been running with guilt's cold grasp on my neck. No epiphany or conclusion will unburden the crushing expectations. 

I'm sorry. I'm afraid I won't ever be bigger than this.
