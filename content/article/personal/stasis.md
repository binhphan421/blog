I think, it was the first time I ever had an anxiety attack. 

Reeling from a night smothered in a pillow and tears, I sat listlessly in my car at a gas station, as the sun battered my face. The weight of my mother's rejection ambushed me from all angles, debilitating me as my brain frenzied at the implications of a dream unachievable. My head stuck between trembling hands. My mind crushed within. These moments would reoccur, no matter where and when. 

In time, I instictively chose a remedy: apathy. Applied like self hypnosis, the idea of not caring, not believing in life would numb me from the terrors that have stricken me and if that fails, I dove into alcohol as an anesthetic. I changed nothing. I did nothing. By night, I was but a breathing husk, inebriated and directionless. Devoid of any thought, any attempt at facing the truth. Delusional, in retrospect. I was still angry, and whether I believed it or not, the body and mind were still burdened by the broken heart.  

Seasons come and go, as the fall leaves rest on the ground. I was invited to my dear friend's housewarming, dear being a terrible adjective for a friendship of 20 years. On that day, even with the temperatures showing signs of winter, there was warmth in me, a burn in my chest that I never knew I missed. A torrent of strangers, drained social battery be damned, it didn't matter. I was happy for my friend. To see his beautiful home. To see him among his wife and close friends. To see him be the person I always believed he was. Honestly, I didn't want to leave.

The week continued, with the sensation and moment fresh on my mind. A kind soul, from that sea of strangers, orchestrated a meeting between her, her friends and me, with hopes that I could become an adopter for Pepper. An action, that I found incomprehensible at the time. Why would you ever introduce a mere acquaintence of a day to your friends in such a manner? Well now, Pepper is sleeping next to me as I write this, and I think I have an answer to why it was so strange to me: I lived a closed life, hiding away from the sun; such acts of kindness are beyond me since I never believed in myself in the first place, how could I take a leap of faith for another? How could I do anything for anyone when I refuse to do anything for myself?

Somehow in self believed state of stasis, I thought I understood it all; this was all I would ever amount too. Yet, within days, by the grace of the friends old and new, first steps were taken. The breaking of my ego. Stasis does not exist in the way that I wished it did. Life does not stop by feigning ignorance. Nothing was set as I'd believe, and fleeing from the emotions, and the truths that haunted me, was a neurotic decision that I need to face. A perilous task, for one such as I, but doing nothing is akin to giving up. 

I will fail undoubtedly. I will suffer from anxiety again when I try to process all that I've bottled up. But in spite of it all, I will no longer look away. I will always try.
