#### Insignificant

You are the shores in my ocean.
I, only but a fading tear in yours.

You are the soothing breeze in the summer heat.
I, the remaining void once you've flown by.

All I see is your touch. Your power.
And the weight crushes me.

Knowing your eyes does not scan the sky,
The way mine dream of you in self told lies.

#### Home

Even after I left my nest, home was still where she was. "Home is where the heart is," and that belief never faltered. Some of us are blessed to attribute comfort in the return home, granted we were lucky to be loved. Nothing taste like dinner at home, right? 

However, as she foretold many times before, life will always have its miseries. "Time heals", yet kills: in the physical world we exist in, and the metaphysical that answers if we want to. She has forgotten how to eat her favorite meals, and how to make the dinner we used to all share. I, what home felt like. Where my heart is. 

Every Saturday a piece of my whole falls somewhere along the way, and dreaded existential doubts lurks into the forefront of my thoughts. As time swallows her whole, my identity is swept along with it. Who am I now? What is left when she is finally gone? Will I ever know what home feels like again?

I try, contrary to the despair. How long I have the heart to, remains to be answered.

*What am I even doing?*

*I endlessly ask myself this question. In fantasy. In misery.*

*When I dream the unreachable. When I live the unbearable.*

*When I overcelebrate third place at a meaningless trivia night.*

*I hope because I want to live.*
