These weeks, I've been living in two worlds. Past and present. Remembering and surviving. With her and without.  

Every step and push I take to right myself in this passage of time is just responsibility. Duty. Something that has been a driving force all my life. Something I dedicated to her. The body can walk on its own. Eat. Sleep. Breathe. I manage well enough in spite of it all. 

Yet the mind does not follow. Together in a waltz with my eyes, my thoughts dance to the moments where she was right here by my side. When I was amidst all the smiles, laughter, tears, words, drives, frustrations, photos, meals and whatever tangible or intangible thing I share with her, I never knew I would be living the most fulfilling part of my life. With the broken promise of eternity, the reality that all things end, I am hollow and escape to memories to dream of when I was whole. 

But the chicken rice at 1.99 Restaurant is tasteless when I can no longer share it with you.

The red Columbia jacket you bought me is cold when I can no longer see your smile when you realize I'm wearing your gift. 

The drive, alongside the Westminsters, the Brookhursts, the Magnolias, the Hazards, and anywhere we used to roam together nearly every Saturday, is empty when I no longer see your oversized weathered sun hat blocking my rightside mirror.

Every meal. Every item. Every place. I live the life I need to, yet only see the life I had with you.

I used to dream we could once share rainy nights together again, like before in the now distant past. The long Ikea couch. Our heads on opposite sides. Feet meeting in the middle. Silence we would share in our most comfortable moment. 

Now, it is the deafening guilt I share time with. On this couch that has never known your touch. In this home I longed for you to call your own. 

I wish we had dinner on the last Saturday you would remember. I wish I wasn't callous with you on our last phone call, when I had to explain your bills were on auto-pay for the thousandth time. I wish on that cursed night, I stayed just a bit longer in your home so I could save you before you would ever fall. I wish that it wasn't the last night that I would ever see you sleep peacefully ever again.

I wish you were still here, because whatever frustrations or helplessness I felt prior to finding you on the edge of life pales to the helplessness and frustrations I feel when I battle to accept that you are gone.

I will miss you for the rest of my life Mom, just like I still with Dad. Please rest. I'm sorry. I love you.
