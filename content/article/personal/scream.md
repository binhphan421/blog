It was a week of connection, specifically friendships, from nearly all phases of my life. From my place of work of eight years, where trust has been built on the shared sacrifice for...well, money. From my high school tennis teammates now turned adulting in our thirties friends. And from my oldest friend, no longer the snot-sniveling scootering neighbor but a dedicated married working man looking to start a family. 

Keeping up with my relationships is something I want to improve on. I've discared so many on the obsessive notion that my mother's happiness was above all. People that were once my partners in crime for late night fast food or boba runs. Someone who I shared ears with, in our commiseration of personal sufferings to each other. Maybe, reconnection is in the cards of the future; but I also want to be present for the ties I still have today. Be the friend they deserve to have when they stuck with me past my failings. 

Time never stops moving, for me and for them. Some are making bold new life choices in hopes that they get closer to the idea of stability in this asinine world. Some are struggling with their own personal demons, and the vices that often grip us when we are at our lowest. Some are fighting the neverending battle for balance, between the age of responsibility bound by new commitments, and the freedom of youth that never lasts as long as we'd hope. And I want be present for them, whether I'm needed or not. 

But connections go both ways, and I cannot expect them to be any better if I don't step into the ring myself. Writing is only a conversation in the mirror. I can never bring myself to vocalize my struggles to those I want to listen. To shout so my friends can finally understand me.

How I cry sometimes looking at the empty room I dreamed my mother to be in. How I weep when I see her lose her grip on reality. How I wailed through tears to try and make her understand only for her to eventually forget my pleas. How I freeze when she asks me when I'm coming home, not aware of how often I blink my tears away when I see her and her time ravaged body. 

How my isolation is starting to sink me in its sea, my raft built on self-assurance teetering on its last legs. How my enigmatic mask is a fool's folly, I the fool who wished he could show how much he just wants to be loved and heard. How my world, as I knew it for years and years since the death of my father, broke apart with a few words, and now I'm left prodding this cold vinyl floor in hopes that I can still piece together something worth living for. 

How much I have hurt. How much I want to scream. 

How much I want you to hear.
