#### Vase

The heart is like a vase: it was made to hold. 

Physically, the core of human function. Metaphorically, the catalyst that spur each moment where you "follow your heart." All held by blood and ceramic with veins and stems.

Fragile. Once broken, whatever ethos that defined us, spills onto and into the earth, leaving us to bleed, with jagged stones in hand, as realization hits: we will never be the same again.

Yet, we will try to put it back together. Dutifully in pain. Proudly in vain.

What has spilt, has changed. What we once held, will slip away. What we used to be, will never be again. We live. We break. We build. We try again.

For how much longer? I don't want to know. I don't.

#### Supposed

I was supposed to know when I met him. That he would be the one I adopt due to an unexplicable force pushing me to abandon reason and rational, in favor of what felt right.

When we locked eyes in our first meeting, there was no epiphany. The human unsure of his ability to bear the responsibilities of being a pet parent. The cat unsure of the giant whom he's never seen nor smelled. Both numb to the magic we were supposed to feel. 

This bled into our first few months together. Each retreat under the bed, hiss with fear, and scratch across my forearms did little to lessen my feelings of inadequacy. I was in over my head. How can someone who believes he failed his mother, and himself have the hubris to take on another soul? It was never supposed to be.

Yet in time, his fears faded, and my insecurities were overridden. Anytime he leaped and meowed during the mornings to alert the world that breakfast time has arrived. Anytime he lovingly headbutted me as he weaved between my legs to show his affection. Anytime he decided to groom my buzz cut as if it was his long and odorless fur. Singlehandly, he clawed away my doubts and stole my heart. The question was no longer why I decided to adopt but what is a life where I didn't? 

I can no longer imagine such a world, where he wasn't here. He is where he is supposed to be and now I know what I'm supposed to do: give him the love he deserves. 

And that I suppose, I'll do.

*Am I growing? In these elongated conversations with the self, am I changing? Or am I still the same monster? Forgettable and irredeemable.*

*The burden of the mind is too much for me. Sometimes, I just want to run home to my cat, and in his presence, deafen the malaise that stalks me.*
