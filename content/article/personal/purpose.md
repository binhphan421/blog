One critic since I've started this journey for a voice worth my belief: It often feels as if I'm hellbent on finding an answer every time I write. A reflection, I suppose, of what little I have in my life.

I don't want my writing to only feel that way. I am no sage. No paragon. I scream. I rage. I cry. I don't know. 

Who knows when the strife will end, but I don't want my words to conjure what I am not. 

I like a romance story. A drink or five every now and then. To lose my reality to music. I am me. There is no purpose. No end destination. I live, just the way, I think I would want to. 

And I hope you can see that in my writing soon.
