#### Ladder

>*Everyone has their own ladder. Some do their best to climb to the top, while others don't realize they have a ladder.*  
>*You came along and helped me find my ladder.*

I hope at the top of that ladder, is where I'll find that mythical essence that will grant me my longed for contentment. Whatever it is. Whomever.

I lost sight of the steps a time ago. Seeing my oldest friend happy reminded me the way up existed, and somehow a new friend showed me where I might find the path. 

All I need to do is climb; but I'm still searching for the belief that I can raise my life weary arms and legs to do it. 

That, I actually deserve it.

#### Four

Shame drove me away.  
Love urged me to try.   
Grief anchored us here.  
Despair screamed, no one hears.  

Shame is why I no longer call. Why my existence has halted at this wall.  
Love I cope for by embracing history. I hope in her culture I escape misery.  
Grief is where we swore the best for each other. Where we dreamed the best left with my father.  
Despair tore me apart from home. And it will tear me apart when your soul roams.  

One. Breath in.  
Two. Breath out.  
Three. Eyes closed.  
Four.

*I hope it works out for you. And for me.*
