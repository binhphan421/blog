I could not imagine who I would be if I was one to never chase answers. Scientifically, personally, regardless of what it may be; the chase builds the foundation of my mind: how I think, what I put my faith in, and where I dream. The abscense of my hunt is the eradication of who I am. 

Yet a chase implies a quarry, an answer. What happens when the hunter loses his prey? When you fail to find that answer? When the tracks lead to a sickening revalation: that you were wrong? When no matter which direction you turn, and how far you look, you are isolated in a cage of towering trees, the sky blotted out by the leaves. A hunter, hounded by his own failures, left to drown in his own despair.

For a year, that despair brought upon by failure smothered me and all that I ever was, and for a moment, when my will wilted under the weight, I believed that was all I would ever be. The very answers that built my foundations became the affliction that caved it in. The core of my thought, and the beliefs born from my convictions has led the owner astray, into a living nightmare. A catastrophe. 

Near a wraith but breathing, why would I ever want to choose life? A life ended, doesn't solve the problems left by ended life, some would say; but I didn't care for a solution, I only desired silence. The embrace of death to numb forevermore. 

Yet, here I am, reminiscing on a moment, where I was confident it was the only way. In my greatest moment of weakness, where I believed there were NO remedies to be found, that I have done all I could, and there is no possibility of a solution, I somehow found an ego to convince myself that absolution from the mortal coil was THE answer. Appalling, in hindsight. Terrifying, then and even now to see how far I reached, to appease a fractured ego. 

This was not the first time, and god, does it hurt to write it, but it may not be the last. The lesson needs to be learned: I do not know what will happen. When I stepped out of my car and in front of my oldest friend's home that November afternoon, I was counting my days. That same night, I started the fight to understand what really were my demons, why did they haunt me so, and most importantly, how could I be free of them? 

So lost in a self possessed search for my quarry, I never considered what it would even take to find it. So haunted by what I presumed was an inevitability, I never gave the world a chance to teach me what I'm missing. So desperate for an answer to rebuild my ego, I never realized that a cure-all does not exist and it never will.

Not all questions need an answer. Imagine with the qualifiers I put on my life, like how complicated it is, how miserable it has been, or how fruitless it feels, that I could find any answer that would satisfy me. The truth is, I have been scared to make the hard choices I need to. Whether those actions are backed by reason, faith or belief doesn't matter. Whether they feel good doesn't matter. To live, you must take that step. 

Even if you're unsure. Even if you don't know. Leave the ego at your heels. Leave the perdictions in your mind. 

You still have a life to live.
