#### Saturdays

Saturdays no longer hold the once liberating sensation it gave from the typical work week. My days with my mother have become the sixth, as I clean for two homes, and remember for two people. The weight crushed me again yesterday, as I broke into sobs before work even started, in the home I wished she would love. 

The internet often jokes (or memes, for those engaged), why does God burdens one with so much as if he or she or they were their strongest soldier? I wonder if they quip in irony, or have truly asked the question: "How much does God want me to bear?"

I fear the answer. God has already left me in pieces. What more does he want of me?

#### Strangers

Why do I dream of essentially strangers saving me from my own struggles? When my thoughts' two hands suffocate me, I imagine those who hardly know me to easy the choke. As if I had given up on showing anything but a facade to those who know me, and hoping those who don't can see through my dance. 

I am the one who folded the winning hand. I am the one who refused to win back my sanity.

#### Difference

You are the difference, Pepper.  

From total despair, your honest eyes a dew of hope.  

From loneliness, your commanding meows a sign of acknowledgement.  

From a brush with death, your fragrantless fur a breath of life.

My savior. My hero. My friend.

#### In My Own Arms

Regardless of the moments lived under the summer sun, when it sets, so does my heart's guards with it. With each second in this dimmed and barren home, each conversation with my own cold air, and each moment recalled in dark silence, I find myself falling into my arms, bare shoulders palmed, as I brace for the torrent.

This is a blessed life I lead, with friends and family who care, and a cat who feigns that he doesn't. Yet I yearn, as even they are only exposed to the one who wears the mask. I yearn for someone to share post concert conversation with, be it adoration or disappointment. Someone to listen to my abashed explanation of the tears slipping down my cheeks after I fall in love with a movie. Someone to hear the anguish wailing from my chest, as I struggle with the puzzle of life. Someone to read me past my preface, and see me as I am laid bare, stripped of my cloaks and shields.

Someone to be the sun in my own arms, burning the thorny vines I have snared around my own heart. Someone who would be mine.
