Let's lay down the facts. 

I don't really know this person. Met and talked a handful of times. Every single one of those encounters, I'm duller than a college math syllabus. No matter how you dress, spin, or portray it: there is nothing here. 

Yet, I still long for the chance to know and understand them. I still delude myself into believing, that within the thorns truth laid before me, deep within the briar, there exists a chance that I've got it all wrong. Blinded by this veil, I grip and cling, bleeding for a hope that does not exist. 

*It'll all be different if I had another chance.* 

*If they could see who I really was, they would understand.*

*When my true thoughts are heard, they'll know I'm more than what I show.*

The issue at hand is really me and my ineptitude in communicating. The veil obscures both ways. I wonder when, the words from my pen will appear in the air from my mouth. When my fear of rejection, misunderstanding, and conflict will finally be outmatched by fear of not being heard. When the fantasies end, the veil is gone, and I live in reality.
