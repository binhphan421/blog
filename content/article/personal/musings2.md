##### Too

Too much pain to carry,  
Too little time to bury.  

Too caught in hope to cut agony,  
Too blind by fear to see it go by.

##### To

I lead a life caught in obsession of details; the very details I believed would help me understand it all. Yet for the thousandth or so time, I'm on my knees, with empty palms open to the sky. I wander a maze of my own doing, unaware that it was my vanity in intellect that prevents me from leaving.  

It is always too much. Too little. Too caught. Too blind. But amount should never change what I feel. What I want.  

To carry my mother's burdens. To heal the souls of those I love, and my own. To cut agony behind, so my hands can grasp happiness. To see it all as it is, and to see myself and not the hounds that chase me. 

This is my one and only life. No time to be caught in the o's.
