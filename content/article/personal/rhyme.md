For a concept wrapped in reason, human beings at our core, seek vindication. As if a primal instinct, we dance within our mental ballroom, in hopes that our expression leads to purpose. To find, why we move at all. Why we step in the manner that we do. 

We all dance in different tunes. Past and present provides the baseline for the vibrations we wade through in pursuit of purpose. Yet in all the varied genres and different instruments, isn't it strange how we all seek the same thing? That somehow in all of this noise, there exist a rhyme, a rhythm, a reason why we listen? Music which lifts your ears: a struck chord resonating in your chest, drumming to the beat of your heart. 

Drowned in sound, you jive, you sway and you tango, wherever the rhythm destines, praying it'll lead to the cathartic revelation we have all ached for. When we finally swing away from the chaos of consciousness, to the realm of poetry, where there is basis in madness, aim in our struggles, and at long last, affirmation in our rationale. The dance yet ends. The music still plays. But we have vision. We have purpose. 

Until that clarity is found, I strum in hopes the vibrations, and motions find my dream: where the chase for beauty ends, and the meter of my life lands the elegance I have longed all my life for.
