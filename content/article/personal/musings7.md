#### Flash

It is ruthless. Demanding. Incomprehensible.

Without reason, and warning, the picture flashes my eyes, mind and spirit. 

The gun to my head. The pistol in my mouth. All that is missing: the bang to signal the dream come true.

This is not what I want. I write of my attempts to understand the soul, finding true love and comprehending the journey. Death is not seeked. Yet, the scenes haunt me.

On another Saturday drive with my mother, as she wrongfully recites her painful history. *Flash.* She asks why I'm gripping my forehead so tightly. I say it's nothing.

On the drive back home, and I glance at the polluted urban California sky. *Flash.* I ask, why in a world of open roads, does my mind remind me of the one I don't want to find. 

On a drunken high in my abode, after watching my favorite movie in the last ten years "In the Mood For Love" at the Frida. *Flash.* I break, sobbing while hugging the floor chair desperately hoping it would transform into...anyone. Pepper looks on.

I am sick of this poisoned mind. Will I ever find my antidote? To be free from these flashes I no longer wish to see.

#### Cải Lương

If you asked me to describe cải lương before my mind spurred this entry, I ineptly would have called it a Vietnamese spoken word opera, ignoring how bathed the art form is in Vietnamese traditions. From the song lang rhythmically controlling the fleet of Vietnamese instruments backing the poetic verses, to the extravagant costumes consisting of headgears with cloth appendages like that of antennas on insects, and color coded áo dàis to complement the larger than life acting. 

In my childhood, cải lương was a favorite of my mother's, with frequent requests for the tech savvy son that I am to setup the PS2 to play her DVDs, as she look for a musical reprieve from a long day at the sewing machines. After hundreds (or what felt like it), I, like many other American born Vietnamese living between two cultures, grew tired of the repetitive instrumentals and the miserable stories they supported. They spoke in a language called Vietnamese, yet sang in rhythms and rhymes I could never follow. Cải lương had little hold on my heart.

Cut to 2025, and with my mother's battle with time and mine with reality, motivation to be involved with my culture and history has found me, and revisiting cải lương in 2018's Song Lang about two men finding a common bond in the art, has brought me here with paper and pen. The passage of time frankly, has not completely evolved my opinion. The lack of variation in the instrumentals irks me to this day, just as much as the melodrama often at the core of cải lương's stories; but an aged mind is definitely more appreciative at the very least of how the art form has brought people like my mother together, like many others before it. Appreciation is not at the cost of being ignorant of flaws. Whether it is the cải lương I found exhaustive, or my writing where I pen in circles, there is beauty in expression. Perfection or not.
