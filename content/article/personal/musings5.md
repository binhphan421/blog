#### Nightmare

I frantically scurried around in darkness. All visible signs pointed to this being my childhood home at Westpark Apartments, yet while basked in the black fog, it became a version I have never seen nor lived in. I was tense. I came upon the entrance, door wide open, and horror over came me, as if my worst fears have come true. I am open to the world, and it has seen what exists here. 

I shook awake, to Pepper and his routine meows: an attempt to convince his owner to get off the goddamn bed and follow him to the food.

Sweating, I pulled the thick Korean blanket over my head, and prayed that for a fleeting moment, I was hidden. 

#### Hana-Bi

There are countless proverbs and quotes that we, humans, have created to will ourselves when we have fallen to our lowest. 

> *It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up.*

> *You don't drown by falling in the water; you drown by staying there.*

> *Rock bottom is not your end; it is your beginning.*

But the depths are never that forgiving are they? A cruel reminder at the core of the film Hana-Bi by Takeshi Kitano, where two ex-cops brave the burdens brought upon them after a routine stakeout goes awry leaving one disabled, and the other burdened with the guilt of escaping unscathed. The once partners take seperate paths in the darkness, and in their divergent stories, we witness when life reaches the breaking point where those who are suffering consider the end of it all: suicide. The film neither glorifies or denounce the act, but the last shot of a child witness of the deed stuck with me; as if it screamed the selfishness inherent in suicide that we stain the purity of those yet to experience life themselves. 

The movie awoke old memories. 

Did I fight to find the path to life like these men did on screen? No, I willingly swirled and spiraled until luck granted me my freedom. 

Am I at this crossing again? Maybe, that is why I fervently write, in hopes that stumbling through my own words will lead me to the bridge over the pit, unlike my previous episode.

Do others have the same lapse in their thoughts? Sickening thoughts and ideas I wish I never even concieved. Sometimes, rationale convinces me that it was just the wildness of my brain. Other times, I wonder if I am the monster I have suspected myself to be all along. 

I liked this movie truly, but I can do without these revived memories. I guess that's on me though.
