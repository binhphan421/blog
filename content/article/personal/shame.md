I never really grasped why I at times morph into a tantruming toddler with my mother, as her life phases into the realm after. Entry after entry, I enjoy the cathartic relief of writing an *answer* only to experience another Saturday frozen in time, both her mind and my heart in constant deja vu. 

Before me: dozens of pages littered in aimless scribbles. A ritual to the all knowing: why is it like this? Why am I like this? Drowning in the tar of my own misery, I pen words in hopes of finding the shore. With each poetic stroke, I will become everything I wanted to be, no longer ashamed of who I was and am today. 

And it is shame that I cling to in this piece to cope with my immaturity. Ashamed of my weakness: no longer resilient to the woes of the world that weighs on my shoulder. 

Ashamed when others saw her hair, the once ocean of black dried to lands of grey and skin. Ashamed when she forgot her cơm tấm order as the waitress looked to me to understand her stammers. Ashamed when she proclaimed today and any other day as the Lunar New Year, like a broken clock hand stuck on an hour it desperately wishes to come.

Ashamed that this is the reward for all those years dedicated to her: a woman stuck in years long past, in a body that is fading with her memories. In her I see the results of that dedication and my shame manifested: I have failed her, as I did my father. Time will slowly claim her as the prize, and I will write of my defeat, as the family man now shattered boy. 

I am ashamed that I no longer know what to do. What I want. That I write, and write only to find myself again at the very beginning. Like a broken clock hand that never found the strength to move at all, praying that perfect hour will eventually arrive, when it has already passed.

Every hour is the same as the one before, and the one that comes next. The present is the dream I have created with that time. But knowing is no medicine. I ache, I hurt all the time.
