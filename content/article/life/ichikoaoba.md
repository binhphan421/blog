The day was a personally planned belated Birthday bash, if you will, centered around music: a trip to the OC Record Show to splurge on vinyls (that I have no clue whether or not are accurately priced), and the main entree, a ticket to see Ichiko Aoba at the Wiltern, bought months prior on a whim from an Instagram ad. 

Shopping is as one would expect (I left with a few Gil Scott Heron and Marvin Gaye records), but my anticipation was all for the late night show, which required a near 2 hour trip through infamous Los Angeles traffic to reach. I arrived, and my senses were met with the brutality of what I imagine occurs in many highly populated urban cities. The tagged abandoned buildings. The stench of overfilled trashcans. The distant stares and gibberish of the down trodden. The quest for cheap parking. The American Reality for many. I bared the streets for a few hours before the doors opened. 

Ichiko Aoba appeared on stage after a great opening act from Owen Pallett. From the first word she sang, I was swept from my cushioned but not really chair, into what I ineptly could only describe as a deep sea. Yet, there is no fear in this darkness, only her voice and her masterful control of it, as it led me through the depths, past the distractions of the inconsiderates of the crowd. Behind that voice, a band of strings and piano, further elevate a transcendental experience. I was washed over, cleansed from the anxieties, worries and realities. I closed my eyes, and listened. 

I found myself, wishing I could have shared this with someone, clench her hands as I fall further and further into awe, and share with her all my thoughts and emotions after this. There were two couples in front of me, one wrapped in each other, and the other leaning forward, mesmerized together at the ethereal moment Ichiko Aoba created. I was jealous as I tightly gripped my hands in each other, feeling the scars left by Pepper's claws. 

Post concert, my return to the streets of K-Town in LA was met with a brisk and cold wind, a reminder of the struggles of the world. How jarring it is, having come from the beauty of live music; and to be honest, beyond my capabilities to understand. I rushed to my car, turned on the music I fell in love with over and over again the last hour, and started my trek back home. My cat is waiting.
