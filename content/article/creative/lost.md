Under the teetering snow, the traveler lies. After hours of wiping melted flakes from the lens of his glasses, he sprawled on to the padded white forest floor, and glared past the wet blur at the sky. What was he thinking, as the snow continued to pile at his flanks. Maybe, it was his acceptance of nature's will, to be smothered by the very perciptation he fought against with such annoyed vigor earlier. His body quickly imprints itself onto the forest bed. He hears the wind whisper as it danced above him. The rustling of pine trees joined in symphonic synchrony. The world was quiet; but the man's eyes stared on. His mind was not. 

Within a blink, his god gifted mattress vanished, yet on his back he still lays. Gone are the slashes and bites of the wind and snow. It was no longer cold. But not warm. No evidence of a physical world. Only in his memories. Only in his mind. 

He traveled back to the start. Before the blizzard. After the reason. The layers on. The boots tied. The snow has yet touched the pines. He walked, arms crossed, grasping on to his ribs, as if he was already in the storm. His skin, still flush with heat. His eyes, the same as it was now, forward but staring at a moment beyond our understanding. Was it a broken heart? A failed dream? Maybe he doesn't know himself. Was it what spurred him onto the trail? Maybe. Maybe not.
