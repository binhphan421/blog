There are times where I wish I was blind. Not in the joking matter because of my high prescription glasses. Truly devoid of the sense to see. 

I am a visual person, or so I think. I love movies and video games. Comics over novels, most likely any time you ask me. And in spite of my attachment for music and the wonders it brings through my ears, it is often where I am and what I see that I remember most viscerally. Not often clearly, but the emotions of the event and whatever my eyes were privy to is captured. The mind, like a photo album. 

But as I age, and the collection grows, like most things in life, there is no good without bad; and now, at the fresh age of thirty-two, I have a fair share of haunting photos. Some, I wish I never took. Broken lens to leave nothing to remember.  

The daily suffering of the world we are witnesses to, yet in enlightment, we only numbed ourselves into believing we are helpless.

The lifeless eyes of my father, and the last discharge of vomit he held back even in death until the mortuary driver lifted him away.

The hesitant look in my mother's eyes when I showed her my condo, the one I dreamed was ours. 

The reminders that my mother is fading, all of her insecurities slowly falling on to me as I watch her grip on life slowly loosen.

In these memories, I wish I never saw. That if I were to ever recall, all I would see is the pitch of black. Maybe then, I would no longer live in two world of two images, the life I live in the present and the life haunted by the details. A hopeless wish, that in physical blindness, when I close my eyes, I would no longer see the moments in life that stalk me. 

But all it takes is one. One perfect capture and you find present. Living in the moment. Carpe Diem, as they say. And life burns on, with my hands clutching to that one picture as if it was life itself. 

I still see her beautiful smile that could never be mine, glimpe of a setting sun behind her as if lighting the path of an angel. 

I still see the light of life in my mother's eyes when she sees her grandson, even if time would not allow her to remember his face. 

I still see the wonder, when I follow Pepper's glare out the window, following birds as his paws rest on the glass. 

I still see the memories, my father pantomiming Popeyes, with his callused war weary hands dancing in the air, as he tried to explain the power given by spinach.

A piece to remind me, even in despair's ambush, I cannot picture the beauty that lies in life even still, if I were to close my eyes. An album needs its photos.
