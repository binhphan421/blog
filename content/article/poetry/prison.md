The mind makes ease of trouble
	The heart feels it nonetheless
Rationale bears so that I am able
	Reality brings doubt, stress
So sure we are, of our progress, our convictions
	But time, the last edict, enacts its fate
	Only when held to our eyes, do we feel the weight
Truth becomes my living nightmare, my afflictions
	Left to crisis in a forsaken grate

Ah, to relive youth and ignorance
	Long still to vines of death
Grey hair, a writing of deliverance
	The mind inside, held by last breath
Within, evicted unknowingly from the present
	Outside, oh the horror; The horror 
	She fades, and I live in terror
My arms, helplessly reach through steel, lament
	Already gone, but I see her, and my error

My mother I have wronged you. My father I have wronged you. 

Mẹ con có lỗi. Ba con có lỗi.
