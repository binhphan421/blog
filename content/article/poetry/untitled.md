The cowardly steps sown,  
no tracks on dirt afar. 

Living in land known,  
I dreamed one in tar.

Reality brought to view,  
A coward clenching scars.

The feet tremble.  
The mind eyes flank.  
But each inch I measure,  
In pursuit. In retreat.  
Still goes forward.  
Earth. Time. Life.  
It all goes forward.
