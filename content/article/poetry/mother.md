The oldest of seven, 
Duty was never a question,
Just an aged Vietnamese lesson:
Family is our obsession. 

Twenty years of a country in strife,
Twenty years, form a life's plight. 
Seventy four years, fallen from journey's heights. 
Seventy four years, duty still drives her fight. 

Duty as a wife, wed and widowed. 
Duty as a mother, rabbits long fled through home's window. 
Duty as a believer, Buddha her final grace, her body hollowed. 

This is my mother.
Family was her only, there exists no other.

*Cảm ơn mẹ.*
