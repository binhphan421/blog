Counting days last her hands were within reach,  
The memory mist my eyes, my present under seige.  

Cross I am, hopeless in lost obsession, to divine ghost,  
Am I alive, possessed to chase spectres, in hapless host?  

Whatever which way my eyes vie,     
I see, her smile under my sky.  

However grounds pull me to earth,  
I fly, winged love yet to birth.   

Wherever a body jaunts to exist,  
I lay, a mind illusion kissed.  

Am I lost, beguiled, deluded, mired in a self-sired fantasy?  
Lost I am, intoxicated, bloated, wasted on crooked pageantry.  

A fear numbs a heart, a future now reeling.  
Remembering days last a voice showed feelings.
