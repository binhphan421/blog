#### Forgotten

If the unforgivable act lies on my destiny's path, I hope at that point in time I am forgotten. A fleeting relic of the past. A shadow of a lost time. Existing only in a breath of remembrance. 

"I wonder what he is up to now?"

And no one would know the answer.

I will fade, with no fanfare, flowers, or footprint. Forevermore. 

This is a peek into the wildness of my mind. I see no commitments to this deed on the horizon, yet isolation often leads me to the unmentionables. And I loathe myself for it.

#### Mirage

In my lowest moments, I sometimes imagine conversations with you. A chat with the empty passenger seat. Windows closed. AC on. 

Where I am honest. Eloquent. Myself, or maybe a self I wish I could be. 

Reality will eventually make its presence heard. It never forgets. Your mirage dusts away with the cold flowing air, as the stalking loneliness strikes, leaving me more isolated than I already was. 

I glance to the right, where self-assurance for a moment existed. Even a known disappointment still burns.

#### Us

Each second shared with her, I slowly lose my breath, and the air once in my lungs is burnt until only a liquid rage exists. Drowning in unwanted fury, I choke out words I never want her to hear. I become the monster I fear. 

As the sharp decline in her mind began, so did my transformation. My full moon appears when I witness the person God has let her become. I once prayed to my father and Buddha to grant her health in her remaining days; now, I selfishly plead they show mercy and free her from the prison of mortality.

Why can't I overcome this fury? These are not the moments I wish for her to remember, regardless of how little she can.

Maybe it is immaturity, making me incapable of being the cognitive adult, as I hold onto my existence as the green-eyed child still believing my mother as infallible. Invincible.

Maybe it is denial that my resignation to this horror signs to the world that I have given up. In my furious flailing of barbs and disrespect, I am convincing myself that even now I care. Even now I fight.

Regardless, an explanation does little to unburden the fact that I am the monster. I don't want this for her. For me. For us.

*A shuffled song from my middle school era, where I wore buttoned-up shirts, had gelled and spiky hair, and sometimes screamed lyrics I never knew I would want to eventually hear.*
