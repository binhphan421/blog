Picking shards of the mind,  
Day after day, a past time.  

Wishes of my eyes to be blind,  
no longer a witness to crime.  

The animals bled from our hunger.  
The children bred to life sentences.  
The world bent by human pride.  

Our presence world turn asunder.  
Our arrogance kin made prisoners.  
Our greed life we've denied.  

Blood on our flesh and hands,  
Do we bring worth to deprive?  

The sins despite it all stands,  
Penance we must to stay alive.  

> Notes:  
> * Inspired by the song: Why Am I Alive Now? by ANOHNI and the Johnsons, from My Back Was A Bridge For You To Cross
> * Many current events have gone beyond my understanding, but the suffering, and pain we see everyday, I can't escape. Especially as I grow older. 
>   * A civilization built often on the bones of others of this Earth.
>   * The children we birth, fully aware, that they too must be subject to this eventually. 
>   * A dying Earth, that we've pushed to the brink to live the way we want too. 
>   * Is it worth, fighting the mental toils that come with life, to live in this world? Is it worth it to be alive? 
> * I wonder if it is enough to be aware. To be empathetic. I don't think so but what can I even do?
> * My inspirations pieces have been such a poor reflection of the beautiful music they were inspired by. I wonder what I want to see in my writing?
