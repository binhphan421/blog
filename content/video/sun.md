For a state generally admired for warm weather, the wind still pierced my textile jacket, as I leaned against my Kawasaki, staring along the horizon of fading stars. The sun has yet to rise, held back by time and earthly rotations, just as I'm restrained from lighting a cigarette under a gas station canopy, albeit for different reasons. It's cold. I'm desperate. There has been little warmth on this long lonely journey and only promise still fuels this drive. 

I strap the helmet to my backpack, against my better judgement. Hours of shivering and mentally whining about being cold, was not enough to save me from my stubbornness. I want to feel the wind. On this last leg, surrounded by her longings. Her memories. Her foundation. The roads are empty, and a handful of nightwalkers stalk the streets. My steed ignites with a snort of smog, and I ride. 

A blue glow strikes the town as my dried face batters against the breeze. I've been chasing a dream, and even with my red eyes beamed on the road, all I can see is that dream. Reality is but a passing blur. The icy air does its best to remind me of the cost. The logistics. The sacrifice of comfort. The terror of being stuck surrounded by strangers. The unnerving and neverending doubt that the dream, is just a dream. 

The Pixel chimes. I've arrived at my destination. I park the bike behind her unkempt Toyota crossover. The horizon shines with the orange premonition of dawn but my breath still materializes in front of me. I look around, like a wild animal lost in human civilization, surrounded by sights beyond my comprehension and understanding. The doubt ambushes. I do not belong here.

The sound of an opening window, turns me from the horizon, and towards the American dream: the white picket fence and the home beyond it. The wind, my long time nemesis, lifts the opener's long black hair. She is wearing her worn oval glasses, the early hours a deterrent for contacts. A pale face and paler lips, missing the light from the celestial sphere that has yet to arrive. With the window wide open, she rests her forearm alongside the window frame, and places her chin upon the hand of the other. She smiles. 

And with its radiance, the cold blood within me surges to life. The reason I dream finds its strength in my heart: The pursuit of her love, even at the expense of reason. Across man made borders. Through gale and ice. Regardless of the time it cost me. 

The rays from dawn, signals its arrival with heat behind me. Late, my eyes have already found the sun. The air quiets. The wind fades. I pull on the hastily locked latch of the fence, and take my expedition's final steps with the promise of warmth in sight. The heart burns again, stoked by the realized dreams of You and I.
