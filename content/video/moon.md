The second month of spring,
Once open, now long gone.
For some, the second spawn. 
Others, the end of past dawn. 

The third month of spring,
Inching towards hot summer. 
Dreams blossomed from her.
With hope our thumb stir. 

The first month of summer, 
Hope of wishes come true.
Idyllic passion to brew.
A summer love, we woo. 

The day, we live in guise. 
Hidden from sweat till moon rise.
Under night light, our boon lies,
Luna's budding, the June prize.
