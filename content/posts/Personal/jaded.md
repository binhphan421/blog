It has been 9 years. With every anniversary announced at a company meeting or townhall, the excitement of such benchmarks dwindles; yet, in that same moment, a building of apprehension. My dedication to family surpressed the thought but even that is under investigation these days. The floor is open. What do I want? 

That dedication was really only for my mother. Work was a means to earn money that would be spent in the pursuit of her happiness. Things don't always turn out how we expect. Now, I dread a life without her. I also, dread seeing her as she is now. I've cut back on the daily phone calls. Weekends visits are just Saturdays. I couldn't bear to be around her as much as I used to. There was guilt. A thought that, I gave up. 

And I accept that. I can't reach her now as her mind and body will no longer recieve it. I lost that battle with time, and as consolation, it gifted regrets. The only path forward, that exuded any level of confidence in being the best possible outcome in this godforsaken experience, was to ease her worries. To show that I'll be okay after time makes their last visit at her bed. 

So what do I want? Work at this company hasn't appealed to me in a long time, and its bind on me was held together by the fact that I like my coworkers and I get paid. 9 years pass, and without my previous driving force, I find myself wondering: Where would I find a job that would give me that spark? What do I want out of a job? Who do I want to be? E-Commerce was never a passion for me, but this goes beyond what type of software job I would look for. AI is a growing and prevalent force in the industry now, and I don't know if I want to be part of that industry.

The thought of even throwing all that time and investment, from college to now is terrifying; but it is only a sign of where I am in my journey. Everything is being reconsidered, with that question I've beaten to death in this piece: what do I want? Not my mother's desires. Me. 

Maybe, I'll follow a new passion. Maybe, I'll still see something in the industry. Maybe, I'm just being dramatic. We'll see, but at the very least, I promise to myself and my mother, that it'll be what I want.
