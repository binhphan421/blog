Frustration. Resentment. Confusion. Regret.

Coming to terms with my mother's twilight years has been anything but a story. There is no consistent character progression. No parts predetermined outside of her eventual passing. A resolution seems out of reach for this plot. Simply, this is me, my life and I've never been straightforward, with myself or with those around me. Slow. Inconsistent. Afraid. Unsure. 

Seeing or hearing my mother these days can stoke an anger in me. Frustrated, that she refuses to choose a chance at happiness, as she lives in a cycle of fear and anxiety, inexplicably and endlessly raging in her mind. Resenting, the fact that she did not give me my happiness, and instead broke my heart when she refused to live with me. Confused, at what I should do now, as I watch her flame dwindle, with every hour she adds to her nightly slumber, every hair that turns gray and sheds to the ground, and every memory that she forgets or gets wrong. Regreting, every second and word spent on her, whether it was a past mistake that contributed to the shell she is now, or who I am today. 

And I wonder if in this vat of unresolved remorse, there exist the reason why I behave as I do now. My progress as a person has been halted, whether it be emotionally, professionally, or socially. My mind can swing from functional to inept at a moment's notice and what emotional discovery or progress I think I've made, is obscured by my insecurities. My fear, of the prospect of living a life when she finally passes, paralyzes me as I have come to realize that in these recent years, I've only lived my life for her, so what purpose will remain to continue this struggle? My will, shaken to the point, to consider the complete escape from it all, the cowardly leap into nothingness. 

Yet, here I write. Here I continue. Powered by defiance, delusion or duty, I don't know. And in this persistent struggle, I somehow find the gall, or maybe the courage, to look towards the sky and consider perspective. 

That through my frustrations, I should see a woman that in all her worries, founded or not, whom is only focused on her children's well being. That through my resentment and broken heart, my happiness may not have been hers, and I should try, no matter the pain it brings to see and hear her, to give her any form of happiness that she seeks in what life she has left, before time takes away any chance remaining. That through my confusion of what to do, I should focus on what I can do, for myself and for her, so that once she does pass and reunite with my father, she leaves assured that I will push on, and remember the memory of both, so that they might transcend their time on Earth. That through my regrets, I should cherish all the moments where she smiled or laughed, regardless of the fact that she may forget in due time. I won't.

It is in perspective, that I may free myself from my own cycle of stagnancy. My frantic state of being. My dread of living a perpetually lonely life. My desire for escape. 

It is in this perspective, that I might live.
