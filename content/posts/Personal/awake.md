These days, I often find my feet at the edge of my mind and reality. The saying goes "an out of body experience" but it has been quite the contrary for me. When I'm lost in the thoughts that bind me, my arms, feet and chest, too are chained. Left to live my mundane days with moments of complete unawareness, entranced with a conversation with myself. Chats that I wish I had earlier, but foresight has never been a strength of mine. Nearsighted, and so certain that I knew what I wanted, only to realize there was still so much to discover.

Happiness. A common topic in these self-moderated debates of mine. Specifically, how would I personally find it? One proposed path, is something I've mentioned before: I want to be loved. Not a love driven by familial duty that I've given and recieved from my mother and brother. Not a love supported by mutual understanding and sympathy that my friends have most graciously shown me. A love where I want to break all that I am into pieces for. A love where my secrets and hidden thoughts, are laid bare for her judgement. A love where, I know at some point, she would do the same. 

When facing all these desires in a partnership, there is a fatal flaw that exists within the main subject. Cowardice. I live in fear of that dream of love. The fear of who I am, and what I am lacking. Rejection. This has become a foil to my desire. Incessantly, they rip and tear me apart, as I walk the edge between the tangible and theoretical. 

*Why would I ever deserve love if I don't fight, even just a little for it? There is no love in cowardice.*

But if I don't find love, god knows, who I'll become? I don't want to be lonely. I want to know happiness.

I wish, I could just say, that I think about you a lot, and I really want to get to know you, if you are okay with that.

*Yet at times, I can only hear myself saying, that losing any presence of you in my life over this may break me forever because I don't know if I'll ever forget you.*

*Maybe I should just forget.*

I don't want to.

The dreams of her keep me going.

*Those aren't her.* 

*I didn't find love.*

*This isn't happiness.*

But that doesn't mean I can't find it. Wherever it is. Whenever it is. Whoever it is.

Its there, when I finally wake up.
