Like many others, my place in America and my homeland has always been put into question. Where I grew up, my eyes and facial features are foreign and I'm not simply just an American, but Asian American. The lack of specificity prevalent in American perspective towards any person east of Europe. Where my parents grew up, my clothes, demeanor, and struggle with the language indicates that I'm not South Vietnamese, not even Vietnamese, but American. Nothing like them at all.

There is much to be said about one's environment, and how it shapes you. As the only US born in my immediate family, I was only exposed to my homeland's culture by my parents, and my community; but it can never be the same. The lack of humidity in every single breath. The crowless mornings. Paved streets filled with sedans, vans, and trailers, rather than mopeds, bikes and rickshaws on wet dirt. Ignorance is to assume that differences have no impact on my understanding and interpretation of my culture. There are grains of truth in each sweeping judgement: I'm not simply just an American and it would be pretentious of me to say that I'm just as Vietnamese as those who live in the motherland. 

That is not to say I do not care about my culture, or at least, I like to believe I do. History of what we struggled through, especially the Vietnam War has impacted me differently as I've grown older. In my younger days, learning of the pain experienced in that time felt like obligation. I had no reactions to the suffering that occured in Vietnam during those years. War movies never bothered me, even though my people were depicted either as savages or helpless. Visualizations of their deaths, nothing more than a backdrop to cinematic score and American emotional trauma.  

I can't watch those movies anymore. The indifference has faded with age, and when I see these depictions of suffering, I can only imagine what my parents went through. My father, a Southern Liutenant, and my mother, a school teacher, were born in 1947 and 1951 respectively. For at least 20 years of their lives, war was a constant, from elementary ages to adults. I can't trivalize that. For my parents, and for all those who lost their lives in that period of bloodshed. Understanding that, allows us to understand why we are who we are. The constant reminder of the horrors. The desires to escape from a country, that for many, has only seen war. The sorrows, in our people's voices, when they remember April 30th as the Fall of Saigon rather than the Reunification Day the victors celebrate. 

Unfortunately, we are powerless in the face of what has already happened. I cannot change history, only honor it. For my parents, my people and to those that would listen: from this Vietnamese American, I offer this lit incense and words, for I remember, and I'll see to it that I always will.
