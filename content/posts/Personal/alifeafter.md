Somewhere in my times at Orange Coast College, my father's final wishes truly sunk in this child turned adult. 

1. Stay in School
2. Take care of Mom

My high school senior dreams of a life far, far away faded in time, as I focused on home; and home was where she was. Wish 1 would be achieved in due time (as what he really meant was finish school), and Wish 2, would be my second job: a chauffeur. 

All my weekends were for her. For her love of shopping at the swapmeet. For her duty to Buddha and the temple that graciously carried out my father's ceremony. For her appetite, a meal away from the taste of home. For her responsibilities as a widow with two sons. 

I was always certain that this is what I wanted. It was not sacrifice, it was my dream: to give her a life, where when we both knew it was time for her reunion with my father, I knew she never felt alone when he was gone. That in those last moments, she would surface the energy for one more toothless smile and tell me she was happy. That would be more than enough. 

Now, the tolling of the bell inches closer: for my mother, my dream and my certainty. Wish 2 nears completion, but there is no sense of accomplishment here, only fear. That after death, my life has lost it's purpose. It's foundation and drive. My compass, once tried and true, buried or in ashes. My mother. My friend. My best friend. Gone. 

Yet, this same fear has been driving me to frantically discover a life I've put on hold. A cycle: fear to break me into dust, and fear to will my primal desire to live. What do I want to do with my life? What are my goals? What do I even want? Grasping for answers in anything makes the slightest of sense. Adopting a pet. Planning concerts and trips. Reading. Getting out of the house for no reason whatsoever. Reaching out to old friends, shamefully regretting my inabilities to keep in touch. Making new friends, albeit poorly. Watching media. Writing. 

Now 32 years of age, still just like that green, wide eyed college kid years ago, I find myself in search of a path. And while, I still scan the sky wishing for that cathartic epiphany, I have learned one thing: I want to be happy. The trail to the life after remains hidden; however, I have a light, and I have my time. I'll walk it someday.
