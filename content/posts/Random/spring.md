An enigma under the petals of a spring tree.  
Radiating in solitude, as if a sign to be free.

In truth, it binds, sinking me in my woe.  
In reality, imprisoned. I'm the warden. I'm the foe.

Oh, would there be a savior, uncage my soul.  
I am so much simpler, than what I dole.  
Just a boy, who wants to be whole.
